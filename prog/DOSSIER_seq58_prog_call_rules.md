## C1.1

### Current Status

- result: `proved`
- diagnosis: `n/a`
- latest episode: `E0001`
- blocker: 
- actual effort: 1 sessions, 1 msgs, 26 steps, 25 tools, 5 holbuild, 1,703,015 tok (1,700,309 in, 2,706 out, 1,649,152 cached), 282.0s, $0.2942892

### Attempts / Evidence

- `E0001` (proved, , actual effort: 1 sessions, 1 msgs, 26 steps, 25 tools, 5 holbuild, 1,703,015 tok (1,700,309 in, 2,706 out, 1,649,152 cached), 282.0s, $0.2942892)
  - Audit immutable baseline, full declaration inventory and semantic charge/refund/access signatures -> Baseline and range coverage recorded in prog/CALL_RULES_AUDIT_seq58.md; primary statement matches TASK; Return corrections already exist in source. (`TO_seq58_prog_call_rules-20261030T113558Z_m0006_t001`, `TO_seq58_prog_call_rules-20261030T113558Z_m0007_t001`)
  - Independent symbolic no-spill charge/refill equation and positive pre-existing spill computation -> Probe theory builds without importing unfinished SPEC rules. Both flags covered; positive spill 7 is refunded to execution even after reservoir-only charge. (`TO_seq58_prog_call_rules-20261030T113558Z_m0024_t001`)
